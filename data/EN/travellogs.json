Meanwhile, Accessories can provide various buffs for Weapons and allies.\n● Every Weapon has a specific resonant Accessory. When you have a max level Weapon and its resonant Accessory, you can ascend them to a powerful Legendary Weapon when leveling later.\n● Enemies in the stages will grow stronger with each wave and phase. Trailblazers can defeat these increasingly powerful enemies by strategically combining Weapons and Accessories and increasing weapon levels to obtain Legendary weapons.\n\n◆ Stage Gameplay ◆\n● In each stage, there are multiple waves of enemies spanning three phases. Each phase concludes with either an elite or boss enemy challenge.\n● Each wave features a specific number of enemies, which will continuously respawn until all enemies in that wave are defeated.\n● In each wave of battle, there is a countdown of finite Cycles. When the countdown reaches zero, any remaining enemies will disappear, and you won't be able to earn points or experience from them anymore.\n● In the elite wave of each phase, there are specific clearance objectives that require defeating a designated number of elite enemies before you can progress to the next phase of combat.\n● Defeat more enemies and deal higher damage to the final boss to earn a higher score. If there are any Cycles remaining when you clear the stage, you can earn extra points.\n● After the completion of each phase of battle, your current Team Level, acquired Weapons, Accessories, and other data will be automatically saved. You can use the saved data to resume your challenge at the current stage after exiting for a break.\n\n◆ Cosmic Voyage ◆\n● From the first stage (Volcanic Planet) to the fifth stage (Blissdream Planet), each stage has a designated initial weapon. In the final stage (Eternal Black Hole), you can choose your own initial weapon.\n● Starting from the fourth stage (Miniature Planet), Trailblazers can choose different Adventure Strategies at the start of each phase within the stage, bringing you more Stage Buffs.\n● In the final stage (Eternal Black Hole), after the completion of three regular phases, there is an additional challenge phase where Trailblazers can challenge a formidable foe to earn higher points.\n\n◆ Raccoon Tokens ◆\n● Defeat enemies in the stages to earn Raccoon Tokens.\n● Cosmic Treasures will be dropped by the stages' elite waves and provide random amounts of Weapons/Accessories and Raccoon Tokens.\n● After completing each level's challenges, you can spend Raccoon Tokens at the Cosmic Store to enhance your stats, strengthen your weapons, and purchase various gameplay features.\n\n◆ Event Rewards ◆\n● During the event, reach a designated amount of points within the stages to redeem stage rewards in the Journey Rewards section.\n● Complete stage challenges to earn Cosmic Reputation, which increases your Reputation Rank and allows you to claim corresponding rewards.",

Quickly help them complete the editing work of the Clockie blockbuster <i>Dreamjoy Memoir</i>!\n\n◆ Event Rules ◆\n● Complete the Adventure Mission \"Stopped Clock\" to start editing the film <i>Dreamjoy Memoir</i>.\n● Pushing the editing progress will help earn sponsorship. Upon reaching <unbreak>100%</unbreak>, you can hold a premiere event to revive the theme park.

Allocating Time Dice to different tropes will result in more shots in the corresponding tropes and different audience reactions, thus bringing changes to the thrilling, comedic, and dramatic emotions of the film. These three Audience Emotions are crucial to the success of the film.\n● Before completion, the film will undergo an internal screening, and different films have varying screening criteria. Only when specific requirements are met can the film be deemed passable during the internal screening.\n● Any film that fails to meet the criteria during the internal screening stage will be deemed an editing failure. Additionally, if any of the three Audience Emotions for the film reaches 0, the film's content will be deemed problematic, which also counts as an editing failure.\n\n◆ Extra Story ◆\n● During the film's editing process, successful completion of the film editing will earn you the film reel of supporting characters' extra stories. Successfully shooting story snippets that contain previews for extra stories will unlock the corresponding extra stories' film and help animators throughout the cinema complete the stories of the supporting characters!\n\n◆ Regular Rewards ◆\n● During editing, there are also opportunities to try different plot developments, which may result in completely different endings from the original storyline. Complete different endings to earn corresponding rewards in Clockie Paycheck.",
