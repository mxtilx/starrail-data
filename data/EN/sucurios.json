		"Story": "After the end of the Second Machine Crisis, many robots became very anxious and were sensitive to any possible conflict. A rumor claiming that mechanical lifeforms will bring about the final disaster immediately drew the attention of all robots, and they formed an expedition team to scout unexplored lands three times. They reached the island at the southernmost tip of the land and dragged out the rumor's creator from a forest enveloped in utter darkness — A master artisan who hid in the mountains to study evil technology.",

		"Story": "After Screwllum, #76 member of the Genius Society, gained a hard-won peace for mechanical lifeforms, Planet Screwllum welcomed a Second Industrial Revolution. Countless inventors created curse machines, probability calculators, and candy guards, and passionately researched topics on the Seven Great Mysteries. As the topic ranking second amongst all, \"Perpetual Motion\" was loved by mechanical lifeforms. A great inventor, ranked nineteenth in Planet Screwllum, presented to the public their own Perpetual Motion Cuckoo Clock at the end of their life — This fine work used the Archimeles Spiral Energy to keep itself perpetually in motion, but the great inventor ended their own life for no apparent reason after receiving supreme honors for their creation.",

This cassette tape records the story of a legendary hacker. His life began in Punklorde's underground water reservoirs and ended in the company of the Galaxy Rangers. It is said that the funeral was a quiet one, with only a game cassette silently lying atop the coffin, serving as a footnote of \"Finished the Game\" at the hacker's final rites.",

		"Story": "The IPC's initial Prototype Cuckoo Clock represents the beginning of Operation Cuckoo Clock. Many are curious why Operation Cuckoo Clock was conceived — Louis Fleming declared that the worship of Qlipoth, Aeon of Preservation, means the IPC needs to protect its hard-won presence. In his speech, he stated that while the Interastral Peace Corporation is now the master of the universe's finances, it still needs to remain vigilant against the catastrophe of Finality. That is why he advocated the creation of the cuckoo clock series to collect information regarding that Aeon, meticulously removing any possibility of the IPC becoming bankrupt or disbanded in its future galactic journey.",

Fortunately, before the plan was passed, the IPC heard that #76 Screwllum was selected by Nous to join the Genius Society. The IPC then made this mechanical cuckoo clock as a gift to appease the new genius. This gift is very unremarkable in today's view, but that was an era when mechanical beings were persecuted. The birth of the mechanical cuckoo clock itself is a symbol of peace.",
